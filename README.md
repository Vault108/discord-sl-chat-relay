# SL Discord Relay Bot

A Discord and Second Life bot capable of relaying messages between inworld Second Life Groups, and Discord Channels, supports (theoretically) as many groups as the second life allows(42 for normal accounts, 70 for premium). This has not been tested with more than 10 groups, your available memory is also a limitation. 



## Todo
- Add Region Restart Evasion with Fallback Regions in the Config File
- Cleanup Code and add sufficient comments. 
- Convert any Commands we need to slash commands and remove the rest, we don't need the standard commands anymore, nor really want them. 
- Reload Capability of SL Event Files, similar to the Discord Ones, this will be also included into the Red Robot SL/Discord Bot Framework.
